# Predict-SolarPowerCoverage
Using Supervised Classification methods to Predict solar power system coverage. 
* Reduced the number of predictor variables by removing the highly correlated ones
* Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM and bagging models for classification using R software.
* Implemented hold-out sample cross-validation techniques in order to compare the classification performance of the 4 models.
* After analysis, Random Forest is best model with 91% accuracy.
