# Predict-SolarPowerCoverage
Using Supervised Classification methods to Predict solar power system coverage. 
* In our entire analysis we see that in what ways we can preprocess our
large dataset and then we have seen in detail the hold-out sample cross validation
techniques in order to compare the classification performance of the 4 models.
* Also, we have seen how we can implement logistic regression, random forest, support
vector machines and bagging models for classification using R software.
* During the analysis we also concluded the random forest classification model is the
best model for classification with generalized classification accuracy of approximately
91%.
* This tells us that if we want to classify whether an unknown tile has low coverage or a
high coverage given the set of predictor variables, the random forest model has 91%
chance of correctly classifying that tile.
